/// two devices running the same game agree on a mode without either being told which, and it
/// is what every cart loads with until its link screen is switched to the other hardware (see
/// `link_kind::serial_option`). mGBA gets none of gpSP's options: it has no `gpsp_serial`, and
/// handing it one anyway is a landmine the day it grows one. It does get a frameskip option,
/// below, but under its own prefix: neither core reads the other's.
///
/// `bios` is whether the card carries a real BIOS (`root::has_real_bios`), and it buys the
/// player the boot logo and chime. gpSP defaults to `game`, which drops straight into the
/// cart; `bios` runs the BIOS first. It is only set when the file is really there, because
/// booting through gpSP's built-in replacement instead spends those seconds on a blank screen
/// — a pause that reads as a hang rather than as the hardware starting up.
///
/// `gpsp_bios` is deliberately left alone. Its default, `auto`, already loads
/// `<system>/gba_bios.bin` and uses it whenever the image passes gpSP's own first-byte test,
/// which is the same test `has_real_bios` applies — so naming `official` would select the
/// identical image. All it would change is the failure path, where `official` puts a warning
/// on screen through the core's OSD ("Could not load BIOS image file", "BIOS image seems
/// incorrect") before falling back to exactly the built-in BIOS `auto` falls back to silently.
/// That is a core-drawn message over slot's own chrome, bought for no change in behaviour.
///
/// Setting this on every load, rather than only on a fresh start, is safe because a resume
/// does not survive to be seen: `emu::Worker::run` unserializes the resume state after `load`
/// and before it publishes a single frame, so the restored machine replaces the BIOS's before
/// anything reaches the screen. That covers a reload for a link too — `session::reload_for_link`
/// flushes and resumes through the same path.
///
/// `colour` is the quick menu's Colour Correction, and unlike everything else here it is set on
/// both cores, because both of them have the option — which is worth stating outright, since it
/// was assumed for a while that only mGBA did. Each spells it its own way; see below.
/// The in-core cable, on a core that has one. mGBA runs both consoles itself and `mgba_link_player`
/// says which of them this device drives; every other core has no such mode and is left alone.
///
/// `mgba_use_bios` is forced off, and it is the one option here that is about the *other* device.
/// Nothing above sets it, so mGBA decides for itself: it uses `gba_bios.bin` when the card has
/// one and its own replacement when it does not. Two cards need not agree about that, and two
/// devices in a session are not running one game each, they are each running both. A pair booted
/// on different BIOSes is a pair of different machines, so they drift apart from the first frame
/// even if nothing complains.
///
/// It failed louder than drift, which is how it was found: the host serializes the moment a
/// session begins, while a real BIOS is still booting, so the saved PC is inside the BIOS. A
/// state whose BIOS checksum differs is refused outright in exactly that case, and only in that
/// case (`src/gba/serialize.c`, GBADeserialize). One card had `gba_bios.bin` and the other did
/// not, and the joiner answered the swap with "unserialize refused".
///
/// Off rather than on, because off is the only answer both devices can always give: the image is
/// Nintendo's and a card without one cannot be made to have one. The cost is the boot logo and
/// chime for a session, on a screen the players are about to leave anyway.
