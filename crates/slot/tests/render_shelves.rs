/// it never moves further in a frame than the spring can carry it, and it ends up home. A row

/// How many carts are on screen is where the two shelves genuinely differ, and the counts below
/// are what they are on purpose. A row of three has exactly three images to give: the moment the
/// press lands, the one that was on the left belongs three slots along instead, which is off the
/// right hand edge, so for a few frames the row is two carts and a space until it comes back in.
