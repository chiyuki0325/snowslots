//! The carousel's edges and its handover to the slot, composited on the GPU and read back.
//!
//! A draw list can agree that a row was drawn while the screen shows a black hole where a
//! cartridge should be leaving the frame: `cart_at_offset` returning `None` for a slot is a
//! quad that never reaches the list at all, and no assertion about the quads that *are* in it
//! can see the one that is missing. So what is measured here is the panel — how much bare
//! backdrop the row leaves at each edge, frame by frame, through a scroll — and the yardstick is
//! another row of the same carousel rather than a number chosen by hand.
